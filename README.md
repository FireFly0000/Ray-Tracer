This is a basic Ray Tracer project for CS 130 (Computer Graphics). A skeleton code was provided. I only implemented certain features and functions to create a ray tracer.
The features I implemented are: Object intersections, shading, and ray casting.  <br />
 To run a test file: run ./ray_tracer -i <test-file> <br />
 To run all test files and see grading score: ./grading-script.py .
